#### <center> Abstract

With the development of computer technology, software has been widely used. The scale and complexity of software are also increasing, but the resulting software quality issues have a great impact on people's production and life. How to improve software quality and ensure reliable software operation faces severe challenges. Software testing and debugging are the main means for the industry to detect and correct software errors and ensure software quality, which consumes more than ~50\% of the software development cost. Software error location in the process of program debugging is one of the most time-consuming and laborious activities. Therefore, studying efficient software error location methods is of great practical significance for improving program debugging efficiency and ensuring software quality.
(`Note: This paragraph talks about the significance of the research. That is, why we need to study `)

In recent years, software error location has become one of the hot topics of research at home and abroad. Researchers are concerned about how to use the software's own information and the information during the software test process to carry out automatic error location. On the one hand, by executing a certain program to be tested multiple times, recording and collecting the program's execution information, and using statistical methods to calculate the suspiciousness of the program entity; on the other hand, using program analysis technology to accurately identify the dependencies between program entities, and finally identify and locate software errors. However, the existing software error location technology faces challenges in practice, which are mainly manifested in: (1) Insufficient use of program structure information in the error location process. Most error location techniques simply collect coverage information and execution results during program execution and use statistical methods to identify and locate errors; (2) The proposed error location techniques lack theoretical analysis and demonstration. Most error location techniques use benchmark test programs to conduct empirical research to demonstrate their location efficiency. However, due to certain differences between actual programs and benchmark programs, it is difficult to guarantee the efficiency of these methods when locating errors in real programs; (3) The location reports given by existing error location techniques are of limited help to error location practice, and it is difficult for software maintainers to directly use their location results to debug programs.
(`Note: This paragraph talks about the current status and existing problems of research. That is, the problems that my paper research needs to solve`)

Starting from program analysis, this paper first analyzes program dependencies and combines software testing technology to study slicing-based software error location methods in response to the above challenges; secondly, it conducts theoretical analysis and empirical research on various factors that affect error location efficiency; then it conducts research on the error location problem of evolving software; and finally, it conducts preliminary exploration of heuristic interactive debugging methods.
(`Note: This section talks about the research ideas and work content. That is, what are the main things I did in my thesis research`)

Specifically: (1) In view of the problem that the error location method does not make sufficient use of program information, a software error location method based on hybrid slicing spectrum (HSS) is proposed. This method combines the advantages of full slicing, execution slicing and program spectrum, increases the use of program dependency information in the error location process, and improves the accuracy and efficiency of software error location; (2) In view of the problem that theoretical research on the efficiency evaluation of error location methods is insufficient, a theoretical analysis method for the efficiency of suspicion calculation formulas in multi-error scenarios is proposed. This method is used to analyze and verify a set of suspicion calculation formulas, expanding the application scope of existing single error analysis methods; (3)******
