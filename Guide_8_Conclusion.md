### 6.1 Main achievements of this paper
#### [The first paragraph shows your gains in literature search, related technology summary, digestion and absorption, theoretical learning and application]
This graduation project conducts in-depth literature retrieval and investigation and research on ``certain technology (the main research content of the graduation project)``. Through extensive reading of Chinese and English literature, in-depth investigation and research on the fields related to (``graduation design research content``) was carried out. In today's highly developed IT and Internet technologies, I have a clear understanding of the development status and level of (``main technologies involved in the subject``), and I recognize the shortcomings of the technology. For example: ``****; ***** (list one or two shortcomings)``. In addition, through research, I understand that ``*****`` is the future development trend and direction of (the technology). In the process of system design and development, I can consciously apply software engineering concepts and ideas such as "modularization" and "gradual refinement", and insist on using mature software development methods such as document-driven, phase iteration, and continuous improvement to ensure the quality and efficiency of software development. Therefore, in the work of ``graduation design *** subject``, I have experienced and applied the above scientific theories and methods.

#### [Second paragraph, talk about how to implement the system]
In the process of system implementation, first investigate the existing available technologies, such as ``***, *** and *** technologies``, and analyze and compare their advantages and disadvantages from the perspectives of ``*** and ***``, and construct ``n`` kinds of solutions for ``**** (graduation design subject)`` candidates. We further select the best feasible solution based on the realistic conditions of ``society, health, safety, law, culture and environment``. ``[Technical route, this sentence can be adapted from the corresponding part of the abstract to here]``First, ``*****``; secondly, ``*****``; then, ``*****``; finally, ``******``. We conducted experimental verification and testing on the ``**** system (tools, research objects, etc.)``, and the results showed that: ``**** (system, method, tool) implemented based on **** technology`` has *****`` advantages and has important practical significance.

### 6.2 Future work prospects
#### [The third paragraph, talking about the lack of theory and method]
This graduation project is based on ``XX technology (the main research content of the graduation project)`` to carry out the ``**** system or tool practice``. However, subject to the constraints of ``*****`` conditions, this method (theory) has ``***`` deficiencies in practice. For example, ``******** method (technology or means)`` is good at ``*****``, but in reality, ``***`` conditions are often difficult to meet, which to a certain extent restricts the promotion of ``certain technology``.
#### [The fourth paragraph, talk about the constraints of specific technologies]
When we developed the ``**** graduation design system (tool)``, we mainly used ``**** technology, **** technology and **** technology``, but these technologies are only valid under the ``**** premise conditions``. In reality, due to the existence of ``**** factors and **** factors``, the practical efficiency and effect of these technologies are restricted. Thus restricting the scope of application of these technologies. The next step can be to explore the development of ``*** technology`` in the ``**** field``. Or the combination of ``**** technology`` and ``another type of technology``, so as to try to avoid the difficulties faced by ``***** technology``
