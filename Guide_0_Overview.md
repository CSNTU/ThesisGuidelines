## III. Requirements for Figures, Tables, and Codes

### 1. Drawing of Figures

1. The figure title is centered directly below the figure, as shown in the example:

![](./pic/erd.png)
<center>Figure 3.4 ****Figure </center>

+ Explanation: 3 represents Chapter 3, and 4 represents the fourth figure in the chapter.

2. The text in the figure is Times New Roman 5.

3. Use Visio as much as possible to draw, and do not use Word to draw directly.

+ If you use Visio to draw, you can press ctrl +A, ctrl +c in Visio, and then press ctrl +v in Word

4. Lines: horizontal and vertical; try not to intersect.
5. Box: Use as few words as possible, and try to keep a line of text semantically complete. Align it horizontally and vertically with other boxes as much as possible, and keep the same size;
6. The following are examples of figures:

![](./pic/timecost.jpg)
<center>Figure 3.4 Comparison of Latex and Word cost (title is placed directly below the illustration)
</center>

7. When introducing a figure, the correct method is:
+ **** `As shown in Figure 3-2`, ****
+ Don't say: `"The entire system flow chart is as shown below"`
+ You write `"As shown below"`, what if the figure moves to the next page?

### 2. Drawing of tables
1. The table title is centered above the figure, as shown in the example:
+ Table 3-4 *******
+ Explanation: PS: 3 means Chapter 3, 4 means the 4th table in the chapter. The text in the figure is Times New Roman 5.
+ Try to use three-line tables (place the title above the table)
2. The font size of the table should be one size smaller than the text (size 5) and single-spaced

<center>Table 3-4 Student Information

|Name|Age|Gender|
|:--|--:|--:|
| Zhang San| 18| Female |
| Xiao Ming| 23| Male |
</center>
### 3. Drawing code
1. Frame it with a text box, font size (size 5), single-spaced line spacing. Only paste the core and key code.
1. Good readability!
2. Pay attention to the indentation of the code

2. How to paste code in Word?
1. Generate code paste [Website: PlanetB](http://www.planetb.ca/syntax-highlight-word)
2. How to generate code snippets that can be pasted into Word? [Tutorial](https://blog.csdn.net/u011303443/article/details/50992651)

3. The code example is as follows

![](./pic/sample.jpg "This is the code with line numbers generated by the above code snippet to generate the website")
<center> *** Code</center>

## 4. Format requirements
1. Headers and footers, the body must add headers and footers
2. All English Times new Roams. PS: Ctrl + A select all, set the font
