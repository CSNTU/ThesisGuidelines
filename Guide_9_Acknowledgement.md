This paper was completed under the careful guidance and strong support of Teacher xx. Teacher xx has a great influence on me with her rigorous and realistic attitude towards academic research, high professionalism, conscientious and diligent work style and bold and innovative enterprising spirit. Her profound knowledge, broad vision and sharp thinking have deeply inspired me. At the same time, in the process of this graduation design, I also learned a lot about xxx, my experimental skills have been greatly improved, and I have an intuitive understanding of the development trend and learning methods of IT technology.

In addition, I would like to thank my senior sister for her guidance on my experiments and paper writing. She provided great help for me to complete this paper. I would also like to thank xx and xx for their selfless help. We often discuss how to achieve (**** technology, framework) together. It is these repeated debates that have enabled me to clearly understand the essence of (*** method) and complete the paper. At the same time, teacher xx in the laboratory often helps me, and I would like to thank him sincerely here.

After several months of graduation design experience, I gradually understand the truth of being serious and persevering. Considering the nature of future work, the next step is to (``do some meaningful work)``, such as further research ``***** (technology)`` or continue to improve ``**** (existing methods)`` to improve learning and work efficiency. Software is like people, it is also a growth process of continuous iteration and improvement. My next step is to ``first, learn **** technology, secondly, think about improving **** technology (method)`` and explore ways to integrate with ``another type of ***** technology (method)`` to enhance the practical ability of ``**** technology (method)``.

Finally, I would like to sincerely thank the teachers and classmates who care about and help me again!

Through the busyness and study in the past three months, this graduation thesis design is coming to an end. As an undergraduate graduation project, due to the lack of experience, there are inevitably many inconsiderate places. Here I sincerely thank the instructor for his supervision and guidance, as well as the support of my classmates who studied together, so that I can complete this graduation project on time.
In the process of graduation thesis design, I encountered many difficulties. Here I would like to thank my instructor, Teacher xxx, for giving me careful help and patient and meticulous guidance. My graduation thesis is relatively complicated and tedious, but Teacher xxx still carefully corrected the errors in the figure. In addition to admiring Teacher xxx's professional level, his rigorous scholarship and scientific research spirit are also my eternal role models, and will have a positive impact on my future study and work, so that I can solve the various problems encountered in the graduation design. At the same time, I would like to thank the leaders of our college and department for their teaching and attention to us; thank all the teachers who have taught us professional knowledge in the four years of university. They are xxx, xxx, xxx, xxx, xxx... Thank you for your painstaking teaching. And thank you to my classmates and friends around me, who have given me countless care and encouragement, and also made my university life full of warmth and joy. Without their help, it would be difficult to complete this graduation thesis. They gave me many valuable opinions and suggestions in my design. At the same time, I also want to thank myself for not being discouraged when I encountered difficulties, but instead found the best way to solve the problem.
Finally, thank my parents who gave birth to me and raised me. Thank you for giving me selfless love and the great sacrifices and efforts you have made for my studies.
